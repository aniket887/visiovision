# ðŸ“Œ Overview
VisioVision is an image captioning system that leverages BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pre-training) to generate natural language descriptions for images. The project uses PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers to process images and produce accurate textual captions.

# ðŸ›  Features
Automated image captioning using a pre-trained BLIP model.
Supports both zero-shot and fine-tuned models.
Handles different image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).
Easy integration with various applications using Python.
GPU support for faster inference.
# ðŸ“œ Model Used
BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining) is a vision-language model developed by Salesforce. It combines Transformer-based image encoding with pre-trained language models for enhanced image understanding and caption generation.
